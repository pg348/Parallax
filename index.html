            <h1 class ="hee">THE STORY OF LIFE</h1>
            <p>
                Life weaves a vast tapestry adorned with threads of both joy and challenge, and while the desire for a comprehensive manual persists, its absence infuses the journey with a touch of spontaneity. As the sands of time slip through our fingers, whether embarking on new adventures post-education or traversing unexplored paths in our personal lives, the canvas of the future remains open for us to shape.

                From the dawn of rational thought, humanity has grappled with the enigma of existence across diverse religious beliefs. In Christianity, devotees find solace in the divine plan scripted in the Bible. Judaism's contemplation of the covenant with God, as unveiled in the Torah, unveils profound insights into life's purpose. For Hindus, the quest for meaning revolves around the cosmic order of Dharma.
                
                In the rich tapestry of Hinduism, life's purpose intertwines with the concept of Dharma, an intricate tapestry of duty, righteousness, and cosmic order. The question of one's Dharma becomes a guiding light, emphasizing ethical conduct and the interconnectedness of all living beings. How does one discern their Dharma, and what lessons does it hold for a purposeful life?
                
                As with other faiths, the journey of a Hindu is illuminated by sacred scriptures, with the Bhagavad Gita standing as a beacon of wisdom. Amidst the collective narrative, individuals seek personal enlightenment, grappling with the question of Dharma on the intricate path of life. How does one uncover their Dharma and navigate the cosmic dance of existence?

        <h1>WHY A REASON ?</h1>
        <p> Everything happens for a reason. From every experience of your life you will see the shadow can't beat the
            sun, sadness can't beat happiness, anger can't beat smile, frustration can't beat patience, hate can't beat
            love, inhumanity can't beat kindness, failure can't beat success.

            <p> Why not take a cup of coffee to taste the morning breeze?
                It will let you know that how simple life can create a beautiful moment.
                Don't worry if you feel sad because you can easily find beautiful moments from anywhere.
                Beautiful moments belong to happiness.
